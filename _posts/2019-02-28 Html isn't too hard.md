At  first I was extremely confused, slowly but surely I was able to catch on.
Of course  at about the same time  is when i was instructed to create a hyper 
link imbeded insome text.  I really want to see if I could input the instruction
without copy paste ir filpin back. I entered the script to the best of my ability,
committed, pulled, and merged. When I was finally allowed to visit the mock up site.
I scrolled right to the links hoping, I would be whisked away to the site of my earlier
typing... I have never been so thrilled about opening a link. There it was today went
very well but I know it is all up hill for here on out.
